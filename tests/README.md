# Binary Trees

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on implementing and manipulating binary trees in C.

## Description

The goal of this project is to understand and implement various operations on binary trees, including creation, traversal, insertion, deletion, and property checks. This is a foundation for more complex data structures like Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, and Heaps.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of a binary tree and its structure
- Be able to implement basic binary tree operations in C
- Recursively traverse trees using preorder, inorder, and postorder
- Understand and manipulate different tree types: Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL, and Heap
- Handle memory management for dynamic tree structures
- Write readable and maintainable C code using Betty style

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Compilation: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, GCC with flags:
